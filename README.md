Background:
    Old School Runescape (OSRS) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game that was rebooted from a game that was popular between 2001 – 2012

    At any give time, there are between roughly 50,000 – 150,000 players online

    There is no set path, and players can choose to complete hundreds of quests, slay monsters, or train any one of 23 different skills


What is the Problem?
    With 23 different skills to train, it is often hard to decide what you want to train next.
    For people with a short attention span like myself, sometimes I find myself wondering what is the quickest level I can gain.
    
    In addition, some exclusive content is unlocked when you reach a certain "Total Level" which is the sum of all of your skills.
    For example, you unlock new worlds at Total Levels of 1500, 1750, 2000, 2200, and 2277 (max)
    
    Here are some common questions you see online on Reddit or various other forms:
        - What is the quickest skill to level up?
        - What is the quickest way to gain X levels with my current stats?
        - For example, somebody might need 30 levels to reach 2000 total and they want to know what is the quickest way to get here.
        

My Goal:
    Initially my goal was to write a program that looks up my current stats on the High Scores and then tells me what is going to be the quickest level up.
    After I had that working, I decided to keep working and allow it calculate additional levels, assuming you train in the order listed.
    This answers both questions of "What is my quickest level up" (e.g. n = 1), and also "What is the quickest way to gain X levels"
    


How to use:
In the command prompt in the proper directory, type 'python Run.py' and click enter.
You will be prompted for a "Username" and "How many levels you need", and then the program will do the rest!
